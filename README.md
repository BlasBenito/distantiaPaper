This repository contains the electronic supplementary materials of the paper “distantia: an open-source toolset to quantify dissimilarity between multivariate ecological time-series”, authored by Blas M.
Benito, and John H. Birks.

The main file is **ESM.Rmd** (its pdf version is named ESM.pdf), which contains the code to perform the analyses shown in the paper. It depends on the file **sensitivity_functions.R**, which contains the functions used to perform the sensitivity analysis of the dissimilarity metrics implemented in the package.

The folder **data** contains the data used in these analyses as .RData files.
The folder **output** contains the figures, tables, and the output of the sensitivity analysis.
