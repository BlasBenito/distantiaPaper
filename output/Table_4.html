\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-40}Dissimilarity in temperature, rainfall, and EVI, between Fagus sylvatica populations in Spain, Germany, and Sweden. Psi represents dissimilarity, Psi NULL is the null expectation of psi, computed as the average of 999 psi values obtained from restricted permutations of the input datasets, and p represents the proportion the psi-null values that were lower than the psi obtained on the observed datasets.}
